# My Programming Projects

## The Paddle Game:
This is a console-based paddle game built in C#.

The player uses the Up and Down arrow keys to control a verticle paddle on the right of the gameboard. They are playing against an **AI-controlled opponent** the left. A ball bounces around the play area, and the goal is to hit the ball past your opponent’s paddle to score points. The first player to reach **3 points** wins the match.

>Players can choose from 3 difficulty levels: Easy, medium, or hard.

Each time a point is score by either player, it unlocks a **random game mode** for the next round. Random game modes include:
- **Ghost Ball** – The ball briefly disappears at intervals.
- **Fast Ball** – The ball moves faster than normal.
- **Small Paddle** – The paddles become shorter.
- **Drunk Paddle** – The player’s paddle may randomly move on its own.
- **Curve Ball** – The ball’s vertical direction randomly shifts as it moves.

Difficulty levels were implemented by programming the AI-controlled opponent to have variable accuracy based on the selected setting. The lower the difficulty, the more often the opponent will miss the ball.

```C#
if (CurrentDifficulty == 1) HitOrMiss = r.Next(0, 2);
if (CurrentDifficulty == 2) HitOrMiss = r.Next(0, 5);
if (CurrentDifficulty == 3) HitOrMiss = r.Next(0, 9);
```
If the random number generated each iteration through the game loop is a 0, the opponent will miss the ball.

This resulted in the following miss rate:

>Difficulty | Miss frequency
>|----|----|
>Easy | 50% 
>Medium | 20% 
>Hard |~11%

### What I learned
This project was very challenging as it was by far the largest project I had ever done. However, that also made it the most rewarding. This project was my first introduction to **game loops**, **object movement**, **simple AI methodology** and **collision detection**. Implementing different difficulty levels and game modes made me think more creatively and critically about logic and structure. Overall, this project greatly deepened my understanding of how to build code in a structured and robust way.
