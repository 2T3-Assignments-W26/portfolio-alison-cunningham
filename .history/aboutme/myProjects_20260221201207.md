## The Paddle Game:
This is a console-based Paddle Game built in C#.

The player uses the Up and Down arrow keys to control a verticle paddle on the right of the gameboard. They are playing against an AI-controlled opponent the left. A ball bounces around the play area, and the goal is to hit the ball past your opponent’s paddle to score points. The first player to reach **3 points** wins the match.


Each time a point is score by either player, it unlocks a random game mode for the next round. Random game modes include:
- **Ghost Ball** – The ball briefly disappears at intervals.
- **Fast Ball** – The ball moves faster than normal.
- **Small Paddle** – The paddles become shorter.
- **Drunk Paddle** – The player’s paddle may randomly move on its own.
- **Curve Ball** – The ball’s vertical direction randomly shifts as it moves.
