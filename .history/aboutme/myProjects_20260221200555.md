## The Paddle Game:
This is a console-based Paddle Game built in C#.

>Each time a point is score by either player, it unlocks a random game mode for the next round. Random game modes include:
>- **Ghost Ball** – The ball briefly disappears at intervals.
>- **Fast Ball** – The ball moves faster than normal.
>- **Small Paddle** – The paddles become shorter.
>- **Drunk Paddle** – The player’s paddle may randomly move on its own.
>- **Curve Ball** – The ball’s vertical direction randomly shifts as it moves.
